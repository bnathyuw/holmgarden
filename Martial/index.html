		<h2>The Martial Art</h2>
		<p id="intro">
			Shaolin Kung Fu is the root of all martial arts, originally developed in the Shaolin
			Monastery in China about 1,500 years ago. Since then it has branched into many schools
			such as Chauan, Choy-Li-Fatt, Hong Ka, Praying Mantis, Tai Chi Chuan, Wing Choon,
			and many others. Master Pao has incorporated the Southern Shaolin &ndash; known
			for complex and powerful fast-hand moves &ndash; and the Northern Shaolin &ndash;
			with its kicking techniques &ndash; into one Kung Fu system. Master Pao&rsquo;s
			system is an effective physical and mental discipline of practical self-defence,
			combined with Qi Gong for the cultivation of body and mind. The aim is not only
			to enable one to learn the best skills to defend oneself, but also to strengthen
			and increase vital energy and prevent illness.</p>
