		<h3>Grandmaster David C. V. Wang</h3>
		<p class="first">
			A martial art Instructor with more than 35 years&rsquo; teaching experience. His
			students, numbering more than 6,000, include many from overseas.</p>
		<p>
			Master Wang was first introduced to Chinese Kung Fu as a little boy by his Grandmaster
			grandfather &ndash; a fully fledged Chinese Kung Fu Instructor. As a teenager he
			took the opportunity to learn from many great martial arts masters. Soon fighting
			became his second nature. He experimented in various martial arts and became engrossed
			with the Japanese martial arts, taking up Judo, where he managed to clinch the heavy
			weight title in his Malaysian state &ndash; being the lightest in that category.</p>
		<p>
			The martial art that took the longest time for Grandmaster Wang to master was Shorinji
			Kempo, in which he has been awarded a 5th Dan Daikenshi. He now teaches a practical,
			all-rounded, organised martial art derived from more than 3 decades of experience
			in fighting and from his relentless efforts in experimenting. His principle in teaching
			is <q>&ldquo;I do not teach my students to anticipate a fight, but if a fight is unavoidable,
				they are prepared for it&rdquo;</q>.</p>
		<p>
			He is author of <cite>From the Fist to the Heart &ndash; Teaching people the martial
				arts way</cite>, a series of 3 books covering fundamental, intermediate and
			advanced defensive and offensive techniques.</p>
		<h4><cite>From the Fist to the Heart &ndash; Teaching people the martial arts way</cite></h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The first volume addresses the basics, principles and fundamental elements of offence
				and defence techniques. It stresses the importance of mastering the basics, because
				all techniques and forms are the products of organised basics. Bad techniques come
				from poor basics. It also emphasises speed training as the source of power. The
				ultimate aim is to develop your &lsquo;conditioned reflex&rsquo;. Beyond speed is
				reflex. You can control your speed but not your reflex. </li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The second volume addresses the techniques of releasing, twist-locks, throwing and
				pinning. You are advised to understand the underlying principles of the releasing
				and twist-lock techniques before you attempt the techniques themselves. In this
				way you will find it easier to practice. Most of the twist-lock techniques illustrated
				need to be exercised with caution so as to avoid serious injury to your joints.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The third volume focuses on the application of human vital points. The vital points
				are clearly shown and the applications are illustrated in series of photographs.
				However, the vulnerable or knockout points are meant only as an indication and you
				should not experiment with them in practise with your partners. Resuscitation is
				also illustrated in a series of photographs, demonstrating how to revive someone
				who has been struck and lost consciousness. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Master Pao</h3>
		<p class="first">
			With over 15 years of teaching exprience in Shaolin Kung Fu in United Kingdom, his
			view of teaching is that there is nothing more noble than to &lsquo;share&rsquo;
			what you know. Although there are hundreds of different styles of Kung-Fu, it can
			essentially be divided into two main schools, the hard and soft styles. He has integrated
			soft and hard techniques into one cohesive system of defensive and offensive techniques
			for men and women. This comprehensive programme helps you to develop a sound knowledge
			of fighting techniques and how to handle any combat situation.</p>
		<p>
			His book &lsquo;The Tao of Kung-Fu&rsquo;. will help you to discover that Kung-Fu
			is not only a form of health enhancing exercise and a highly effective system of
			self-defence, but it also promotes personal mental and spiritual well-being, encouraging
			balanced energy in a person&rsquo;s life. The aims of practicing Kung-Fu are to
			cultivate positive energy to invigorate every aspect of your life, to awaken the
			full human potential, to improve how you engage with others, and to enable you to
			live life to its full potential.</p>
		<p>
			As Master Pao affirms, the principle of Kung-Fu is not a thing that can be learned
			as a theoretical discipline or through instructions from books. The ultimate object
			of Kung-Fu is to cultivate the body, mind and spirit, develop one&rsquo;s moral
			discipline. It involves much more than the exhibition of strength and power. It
			connects the body, mind and spirit - the oneness where form has no form &ndash;
			like water. When you treat it softly it becomes soft and when you strike it hard
			it becomes hard.</p>
